        <h1 class="detail-title">Brookline's FY27-FY31 Long Range Financial Forecast</h1>
        <p class="detail-subtitle">
          The FY27-FY Long Range Financial Plan was presented to the Advisory
          Committee on January 13, 2026.
        </p>

        <p class="detail-copy">
          The Brookline FY2027-FY2031 Long-Range Financial Plan, presented in
          January 2026, outlines a challenging fiscal outlook characterized by a
          significant structural deficit and the expiration of federal
          pandemic-era funding.
        </p>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong>Financial Outlook and Deficits</strong></p>
        <p class="detail-copy">
          The town faces an immediate and growing gap between projected revenues
          and the costs required to maintain current service levels.
        </p>
        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>
            Total Structural Deficit: For FY2027, the town and schools face a
            combined deficit of approximately $16.6 million (which grows
            cumulatively to over $42 million by FY2031).
          </li>
          <li>
            School Deficit: The Public Schools of Brookline (PSB) account for
            the largest portion of the gap, with a projected $13.5 million
            structural deficit in FY2027.
          </li>
          <li>
            Town Deficit: Municipal departments face a $2.9 million structural
            deficit in FY2027.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong>Key Cost Drivers</strong></p>
        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>
            Personnel Benefits: Employee benefits are the single largest driver
            of expenditure growth. Health insurance rates are projected to
            increase by 12% in FY2027, with annual 10% increases thereafter.
          </li>
          <li>
            ARPA Expiration: Federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding
            expires in December 2026. While the town has prepared for this, the
            loss of these funds creates pressure to find new revenue for popular
            programs like Senior Medical Transit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inflation and Collective Bargaining: Ongoing pressures from
            inflation and necessary funding for police, fire, and school labor
            contracts continue to outpace traditional revenue growth.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong>Revenue Constraints</strong></p>
        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>
            Proposition 2 1/2: The town's primary revenue source, property
            taxes, remains limited by state law to a 2.5% annual increase plus
            "new growth," which is not keeping pace with a projected 7-8%
            increase in expenditures.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stagnant Aid: State aid (UGGA and Chapter 70) is projected to grow
            modestly (1%-2.5%), offering little relief for the structural gap.
          </li>
          <li>
            Local Receipts: Sources like building permits and interest income
            are declining or unreliable, though parking meter revenue provides a
            small bright spot.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong>Strategic Response</strong></p>
        <p class="detail-copy">
          The plan serves as the foundation for a potential operating override
          request in May 2026. Without an override to increase tax capacity,
          town leadership warns of deep service cuts, including the potential
          elimination of approximately 20 town positions and significant
          staffing reductions within the school district.
