        <h1 class="detail-title">MMA report: A Perfect Storm</h1>
        <p class="detail-subtitle">
          In October 2025, the Massachusetts Municipal Association (MMA)
          released a report that examines the key factors pressuring municipal
          budgets.
        </p>
        <p class="detail-copy">
          Massachusetts municipalities provide essential services - from schools
          and public safety to roads and clean water - but their budgets are
          being squeezed by a structural mismatch between rising costs and
          constrained revenue options. Local income and broad sales taxes are
          prohibited, and Proposition 2 1/2 generally caps annual property tax
          levy growth at 2.5 percent (plus new growth), leaving communities
          with limited ability to keep pace with inflation.
        </p>
        <p class="detail-copy">
          State aid remains important but is less generous than the national
          average and has become less helpful for core operating needs because
          Unrestricted General Government Aid (UGGA) has fallen sharply in real
          terms - down about 25 percent since 2002 across community types.
          Temporary federal pandemic relief has also ended, removing a key
          short-term buffer.
        </p>
        <p class="detail-copy">
          While pressure is widespread, impacts vary: rural towns and many
          suburbs have seen real declines in state aid and have struggled to
          sustain education and staffing, while gateway cities have received
          more targeted education aid but lag in other spending areas.
          Overrides can exceed the tax cap, but they require referenda and are
          unevenly feasible. Overall, the report portrays a statewide fiscal
          "vice" that calls for both flexible state support and solutions
          tailored to different local conditions.
