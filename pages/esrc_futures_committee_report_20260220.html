        <h1 class="detail-title">E&RSC Futures Committee report (February 13, 2026)</h1>
        <p class="detail-subtitle">
          The Futures Subcommittee report focuses on economic development strategy.
        </p>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong>A. Core Thesis</strong></p>
        <p class="detail-copy">New development is the primary long-term lever to:</p>
        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>Generate significant new tax revenue.</li>
          <li>Reduce reliance on operating overrides.</li>
          <li>Diversify revenue beyond residential property taxes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="detail-copy">
          Without new net development revenue, Brookline is likely to require larger and more
          frequent overrides.
        </p>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong>B. Structural Problems Identified</strong></p>
        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>Most commercial districts are capped at low FAR, which limits growth potential.</li>
          <li>
            Large projects often require zoning amendments, overlay districts, special permits, and
            two-thirds Town Meeting votes.
          </li>
          <li>The process for major projects can take about two years.</li>
          <li>
            Current zoning reforms are effectively frozen pending completion of the Comprehensive
            Plan (expected in 2026).
          </li>
          <li>Brookline's development approach is often reactive rather than proactive.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong>C. Key Recommendations</strong></p>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong>1. Governance &amp; Leadership</strong></p>
        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>Designate a Select Board member to lead economic development.</li>
          <li>Elevate the economic development function to report to the Town Administrator.</li>
          <li>Improve coordination among the Planning Board, EDAB, ZBA, and related bodies.</li>
          <li>Engage proactively with major property owners.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong>2. Zoning Reform</strong></p>
        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>Use the Comprehensive Plan to pre-identify areas for increased density.</li>
          <li>Implement systematic zoning updates immediately after Plan adoption.</li>
          <li>Allow the Planning Board to grant certain special permits without ZBA referral.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong>3. Development Priorities</strong></p>
        <p class="detail-copy">Major long-term revenue opportunities include:</p>
        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>
            Chestnut Hill Commercial Area (CHCA), estimated at about $5.6M in annual net new taxes
            at stabilization, comparable in size to the current override request.
          </li>
          <li>Waldo-Durgin site redevelopment.</li>
          <li>Center Street lots redevelopment.</li>
          <li>Harvard Street mixed-use parcels (Stop &amp; Shop and TJ Maxx).</li>
          <li>Route 9 corridor.</li>
          <li>Beacon Street commercial centers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="detail-copy">
          Hotels are identified as the highest net-revenue use per square foot due to room tax,
          meals tax, lower service costs, and no school impact.
        </p>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong>4. Near-Term Revenue &amp; Efficiency Steps</strong></p>
        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>Expand personal property audits (already producing about $200k in additional revenue).</li>
          <li>Streamline permitting and business licensing.</li>
          <li>Encourage PILOT participation from nonprofits.</li>
          <li>Protect commercial district infrastructure (parking, lighting, signage).</li>
        </ul>
