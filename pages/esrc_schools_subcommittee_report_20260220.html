        <h1 class="detail-title">E&RSC Schools Subcommittee report (February 9, 2026)</h1>
        <p class="detail-subtitle">
          Two major financial findings areas are discussed: Unreimbursed Special Education for
          Non-Resident Students and Teacher Salaries.
        </p>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong><u>Unreimbursed Special Education for Non-Resident Students:</u></strong></p>
        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>144 non-resident students receive in-district special education services.</li>
          <li>Estimated direct in-district cost per student (FY23-24):</li>
          <li>~$30,130 including transportation.</li>
          <li>~$27,972 excluding transportation.</li>
          <li>Applying $27,972 per student to 144 students = $4 million annually in unreimbursed costs.</li>
          <li>
            Brookline receives METCO grant funding (~$8,000 per student), but this largely covers
            METCO-specific staffing and transportation, not general educational programming.
          </li>
          <li>No reimbursement for in-district special education from Boston or other sending districts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong>Additional concern:</strong></p>
        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>Non-resident students have a higher special education participation rate than resident students.</li>
          <li>Brookline receives below-average METCO reimbursement compared to peer communities.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong>Recommendation direction:</strong></p>
        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>Collaborate with Newton and Lexington to advocate for increased state funding.</li>
          <li>Reassess long-term sustainability of subsidizing sending districts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong><u>Teacher Salaries</u></strong></p>
        <p class="detail-copy">The salary report (pp. 14-18) highlights:</p>
        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>
            Roughly half of Brookline teachers receive annual raises above the contractual 2.75%
            COLA due to step progression.
          </li>
          <li>
            Actual annual increases range from 5.3% to 8.0% depending on position and movement on
            the salary scale.
          </li>
          <li>
            Brookline teacher salaries exceed those of comparable districts (Boston, Cambridge,
            etc.) at most steps, in some cases by $1,000-$5,000+.
          </li>
          <li>Healthcare contributions are relatively generous (83% employer contribution for PPO/HMO plans).</li>
          <li>Brookline high school teaching loads are lower than many peer districts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="detail-copy"><strong>Conclusion of the report:</strong></p>
        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>Real salary growth (steps + lanes + COLA) outpaces inflation and revenue growth.</li>
          <li>
            Long-term sustainability requires alignment of compensation growth with realistic revenue
            projections, especially absent recurring overrides.
          </li>
        </ul>
